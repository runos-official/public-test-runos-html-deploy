                        <p>The Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, Earth's first artificial satellite, weighing 83.6 kg and orbiting Earth every 96 minutes. This marked the beginning of the Space Age.</p>

                        <p>SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets can land their first stages for reuse, dramatically reducing launch costs. The Falcon 9 can lift 22,800 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p>

                        <p>Launched in 2021, JWST orbits the Sun at the L2 Lagrange point, 1.5 million km from Earth. Its 6.5-meter mirror observes infrared wavelengths, seeing further back in time than ever before.</p>

                        <h3>Escape Velocity</h3>
                        <p>To leave Earth's gravitational pull, spacecraft must reach 11.2 km/s (40,320 km/h or 25,020 mph). This is why rockets need such powerful engines and multiple stages.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-block">
                        <h3>Orbital Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>Objects in orbit are constantly falling toward Earth but moving forward fast enough to keep missing it. The ISS falls approximately 8 meters for every kilometer it travels forward.</p>

                    <div class="info-block">
                        <h3>Microgravity Effects</h3>
                        <p>In space, astronauts experience bone density loss of 1-2% per month, muscle atrophy, and fluid shifts. Exercise 2-3 hours daily is required to counteract these effects.</p>

                    <div class="info-block">
                        <h3>Radiation Exposure</h3>
                        <p>Astronauts on the ISS receive about 150 mSv per year, equivalent to roughly 800 chest X-rays. A Mars mission would expose crew to 500-700 mSv during the journey alone.</p>

                        <p>The ISS recycles about 90% of water from condensation, urine, and sweat. Each astronaut needs roughly 30 kg of consumables per day including water, food, and oxygen.</p>
